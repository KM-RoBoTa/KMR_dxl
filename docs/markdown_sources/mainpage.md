# Introduction {#mainpage}
[TOC]

This library is a C++ wrapper around Dynamixel's SDK library for **protocol 2** motors, written for Linux, currently supporting x86 and armv7l processor architectures. <br /> 
It uses SI units, the only exception being temperature expressed in Â°C instead of Kelvins.

Its main strength lies in its hardware abstraction layer that frees the user of having to check the motors' control tables. Many common functions are available out of the box, using Dynamixel's sync write and sync read functions in the background. <br /> 
For not implemented functionalities, as well as for the creation of custom readers and writers (including indirect ones), this library provides functions to create and destroy them very easily.

In addition to a full documentation, this library also provides several examples to illustrate its use.
